    "# Text Based Adventure Game - Cinderella Retold\n",
    "\n",
    "This text adventure game is based on the classic fairytale - **Cinderella**, written by the acclaimed French author, Charles Perrault. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Storyline\n",
    "\n",
    "Until her mother passes away, Cinderella lives happily with her parents. After her mother's demise, Cinderella's pained father remarries a cold, cruel woman who has two daughters. They force Cinderella to do everything for them. <br>\n",
    "One day, the entire town receives an invitation to a ball at the palace. To prevent Cinderella from coming to the ball, her stepmother hands her a big list of chores to be done, which makes Cinderella extremely disappointed. Suddenly, a fairy godmother appears and helps Cinderella get to the ball. Cinderella and the Prince dance at the ball, where he falls in love with her. She sprints as quickly as she can at midnight, leaving her glass slipper behind. <br>\n",
    "The prince goes to every house in the kingdom, tests the shoe on a lot of different women, and then decides to marry the woman whose feet the shoe fits (Perrault & Brown, 1954).<br>\n",
    "Few situations for the alternative plot lines have been referenced from an online game website (Davey, 2017).\n",

    "\n",
    "This game traverses Cinderella’s quest of finding her happily ever after. Through a series of situations, the player can explore alternative plot-lines and subsequent endings based on different decisions and choices.\n",

    "## Possible bugs\n",
    "\n",
    "- For some situations, if the player presses 'Enter' instead of any other key, Python automatically chooses option 1. However, for most situations, it requests the user to give a valid input as defined through the if-elif-else clause.\n",
