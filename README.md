# Python Text Adventure Game

## Project Description
In this assignment, students are tasked with designing a text-based adventure gameLinks to an external site.. This game should utilize the Python essentials covered thus far, including, but not limited to:

Strings and String Manipulation
User-Defined Functions and Objects (variables)
User Input and Input Handling
Conditional and Nested Conditional Statements (if/elif/else)
Loops (for/while)
Controlling for Errors (try/except)

The working version of the game should include an executable script (a script that runs from beginning to end upon execution) that includes:
- 3 stages (maximum of 5 stages)
- 5 defined variables
- 1 list
- 1 for loop
- 1 while loop
- 3 nested conditional statements (all must include an else clause)
- 1 win() function (Executed whenever a user wins the game. There must be only one win function)
- 1 fail() function (Executed whenever a user loses the game. There must be only one fail function)
- A description at the beginning of game that:
    - Is no more than 300 words
    - Introduces the story, game, and its objective
    - Identifies any bugs that are not yet worked out
 
Requirements and Restrictions
- Your game must be based on a book, movie, or TV show. Make sure to provide a source in A.P.A. format.
- The only programming language you may use is Python (no JavaScript, C, or other languages are allowed).
- Global variables may NOT be used (avoid things such as combat engines and/or character attributes such as health points)
- No use of class structures or other object-oriented programming structures (you must stick to user-defined functions).
- You are not allowed to pass things between the stages of your game (stages should not inherit arguments from other stages; no optional or mandatory arguments). For example, a key found in Stage 1 cannot be carried forward to Stage 2. However, you can statically write this into your text if it is required for your story.

## Project Outcome

- Developed an AI based text-adventure based game in Python through which a player can explore 6 different
plotlines based on their inputs, decisions, interests, and correctness of responses.
- Through an average of 5 replays per user, ensured intuitive and enhanced user experience and replay value.
